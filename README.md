# 👋 Hello there! I’m Zach
I'm a 31-year old marketer-turned software engineer living in New York City! I recently moved to the city after 12 years in Miami 🌴, so I'm looking forward to coding my way through the cold winter months ahead... 🥶

## 👨‍💻 🚀 Software engineer loading...
I'm currently enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, where I am currently learning the ins and outs of the fundamental frontend languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Building my first-ever(!) project -> my spin on the web-based browser memory game, Simon, titled 'SIMON: NYC' 🗽 🍎
