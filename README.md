# 👋 Hello there! I’m Zach

## A bit about me...
I'm a software engineer who recently graduated from General Assembly's immersive bootcamp. During my time in the program, I've learned a variety of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks to create user-friendly, interactive full-stack applications. Take a look at some of the languages I've been coding in 👇

After 8 years working in technical marketing, I had an epiphany—I felt the most energized when collaborating with web developers and mobile app engineers. This revelation prompted me to dive headfirst into learning to code myself and pursuing a career as a software engineer!

In my previous roles at Ultra Music Festival and Mana Common, I took on projects that gave me valuable experience in marketing's technical landscape, such as managing the development and launch of over 20 website domains, and serving as project-lead for a mobile app that gained over 250,000 downloads.

I'm excited to now merge my marketing expertise with my newfound technical skills as I pivot into the dynamic world of software engineering!
