# 👋 Hello there! I’m Zach

## A bit about me...
I'm a customer-centric engineer who recently graduated from General Assembly's immersive bootcamp. During my time in the program, I've learned a variety of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks to create user-friendly, interactive full-stack applications. Take a look at some of the languages I've been coding in 👇

After 8 years of specializing in technical solutions for marketing teams, I had an epiphany— I felt the most energized when collaborating with web developers and mobile app engineers. This revelation prompted me to dive headfirst into learning to code myself and pursuing a career as a software engineer!

In my previous roles at Ultra Music Festival and Mana Common, I took on projects that gave me valuable experience in marketing's technical landscape, such as managing the development and launch of over 20 website domains, and serving as project-lead for a mobile app that gained over 250,000 downloads. A core aspect of my work was dedicated to implementing and onboarding team members in the proficient use of various SaaS solutions such as CRM, customer engagement, and task management platforms.

I'm excited to now merge this expertise with my newfound technical skills as I pivot into the dynamic world of software, solutions and customer engineering!
